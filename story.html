        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>This section delves deeper into the lore and narrative of <em>Shinya</em>, providing a comprehensive overview of the game's intentions with the world, characters, and plot.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>THE WORLD</h2>
        <p>
        While <em>Shinya</em> traverses multiple realms within its universe, the primary setting is the central realm of Nojathra.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each realm is watched over by a distinct guardian deity whose influence shapes its culture, environment, and the trials faced by its inhabitants. These deities exist to maintain balance, ensuring that no realm descends too far into chaos or stagnates in absolute peace.
        </p>
        <p>
        Nojathra was once no different. An act of betrayal, however, plunged the realm into eternal night, triggering a domino effect that rippled across the universe. The people of these realms now endure a world shaped by fear, ruin, and myth. What remains of Nojathra is fractured, its lands twisted by the darkness that continues to consume it.
        </p>

        <h2>YUUKA SHINYA</h2>
        <p>
        Yuuka is not a chosen hero, nor a willing savior. Bound by blood to the source of the universe's collapse, she is forced into a journey she never asked for.
        </p>
        <p>
        Effectively orphaned and imprisoned for the first sixteen years of her life, Yuuka's understanding of the world is limited and deeply distorted. Mute and isolated, she navigates the world through action rather than words. Her past is defined by abandonment and betrayal, and her choices shape her into a fractured, evolving figure. She is torn between what the future demands and what she can endure.
        </p>

        <h2>BETRAYAL AND FORGIVENESS</h2>
        <p>
        At the heart of <em>Shinya</em> lies a story of betrayal and forgiveness. The player's journey is marked by acts of treachery that alter Yuuka's path and challenge her understanding of trust and loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout the game, players encounter characters whose actions force difficult decisions, testing their capacity for forgiveness in a world defined by conflict. These choices carry consequences, affecting Yuuka personally and reshaping the realms she traverses.
        </p>
        <p>
        Yuuka is silent, not because she has nothing to say, but because her voice has been buried beneath deep emotional suppression. Forgiveness can heal some of that pain, and with it, the world may begin to heal as well, though the scars remain. Yet forgiveness is not always the right answer. Some wounds are too deep to mend, and others may resurface long before they ever settle.
        </p>

        <h2>STORY TOLD THROUGH PLAY</h2>
        <p>
        <em>Shinya</em>'s narrative is not delivered through exposition alone. Its story unfolds through exploration, combat, environmental storytelling, and the people and creatures Yuuka encounters along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fragments of truth are scattered throughout the world, and understanding the full picture demands attention, reflection, and, at times, sacrifice.
