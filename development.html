        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>
          This section will go over the development process of <em>Shinya</em>, including its current status, design philosophy, and future plans.

        <h2>PROJECT STATUS</h2>
        <p>
        <em>Shinya</em> is currently in active development. Core systems are being designed and implemented alongside narrative structure, worldbuilding, and early gameplay prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Development is iterative and subject to change as systems are refined and the scope is carefully managed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project began planning in early 2024, with pre-production focusing on concept development, narrative outlining, and technical research. However, due to school and other commitments, progress has been slow and gradual, with a focus on laying a solid foundation for future work.
        </p>

        <h2>DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY</h2>
        <p>
        <em>Shinya</em> is built with a focus on atmosphere, emotional weight, and player agency. Design decisions prioritize tone and consequence over spectacle, ensuring that mechanics and narrative reinforce one another rather than exist in isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The game favors deliberate pacing, meaningful encounters, and systems that support exploration and interpretation rather than direct exposition. The player should feel immersed in a living world that responds to their actions and choices.
        </p>

        <h2>SCOPE AND STRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>
        <em>Shinya</em> is structured as the first entry in a larger narrative. While the full story spans multiple acts and future installments, this project is designed to stand on its own with a complete arc and resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
        Content is developed with long-term continuity in mind. Openings within the story offer potential for expansion and for players to theorize about the broader universe.
        </p>

        <h2>CURRENT FOCUS</h2>
        <p>
        Current development efforts are being focused on <em>lapEngine</em>, however other aspects such as narrative, worldbuilding, and art direction are also being explored in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once I am able to move to full-production, gameplay systems, area design, and narrative integration will be developed during the prototyping phase.
        </p>

        <h2>ONGOING AND FUTURE WORK</h2>
        <p>
        As said before, gameplay systems, area design, and narrative integration will be the primary focus once full production begins. Alongside that, a main focus will be on refining a combat system that is engaging, challenging, and rewarding.
        Planned development includes expanded environments, additional enemy and boss encounters, deeper narrative branching, and refinement of player choice systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am currently researching more into mesoamerican culture to see how that would fit within the world of <em>Shinya</em> as its major inspiration in style, tone, and lore. Most games like Shinya tend to draw from european medieval culture, so I want to explore something different while still keeping familiar elements that players would recognize.
